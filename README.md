## Hello there! ðŸ‘‹
I'm Ruffa, a web developer based in the Philippines.  

I enjoy building responsive websites and learning new technologies. Iâ€™m currently exploring React frameworks.  

ðŸ’» When I'm not coding, I love experimenting with new web design ideas, reading tech blogs, and watching tutorials to improve my skills.  

ðŸŽ¨ I also enjoy creating UI/UX designs that are both functional and visually appealing.  

ðŸŽµ Fun fact: I like listening to music or podcasts while codingâ€”it helps me focus and stay creative.  

ðŸ“« Feel free to reach out to me at **aranez.ruffa@gmail.com** â€“ I love connecting with other developers and learning from their experiences!

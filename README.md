## Hello there! ðŸ‘‹
I'm Ruffa, a web developer based in the Philippines.  

I enjoy building responsive websites and learning new technologies. Iâ€™m currently exploring React frameworks. 
I also enjoy creating UI/UX designs that are both functional and visually appealing.  

ðŸŽµ Fun fact: I like listening to music or podcasts while codingâ€”it helps me focus and stay creative.
